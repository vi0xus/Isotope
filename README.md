isotope
=======

Isotope is a coldfusion framework, built for fun to quickly learn the language. I wrote this in the first week of learning and it was ONLY made for learning purposes.

This project was abandoned after the first week of coding, the code does not work correctly.

I upload it here as an archive to what I did.
