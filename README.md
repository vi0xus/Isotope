isotope
=======

Isotope is a coldfusion framework, built for fun to quickly learn the language. I originally wrote branch 1.0 in the first week of learning the language, since then I have become bored and decided to start working on this again, rewriting the whole base in the cfscript syntax, it is much cleaner and enjoyable to code in such.
