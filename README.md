isotope
=======

Isotope is a coldfusion framework, built for fun to quickly learn the language. I originally wrote branch 1.0 in the first week of learning the language, since then I have become bored and decided to start working on this again, rewriting the whole base in the cfscript syntax, it is much cleaner and enjoyable to code in such.  I have expanded my learning of the langauge and will continue to update this codebase, I have intentions on using this for anything other than to learn.  This code should never be used for anything in production, it is very inefficent and has many round about ways of handling tasks.

This project is sole a learning experience and I enjoy building and expanding what I have done.
